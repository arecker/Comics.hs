Comics

A site for comics (obviously)

This is my geek week 2014 project.  It's a website written in haskell.

### To Build this Mess

Make sure you have ```cabal``` installed.  If I set everything up right, just clone the repo and do the following:

```bash
$ cabal sandbox init
$ cabal install
```

To run the project

```bash
$ cabal run
```
